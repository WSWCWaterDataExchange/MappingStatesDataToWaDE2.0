Three tables (i.e. Permit_Header.txt, POD.txt, and Water_Use.txt), and these tables include the most current data.
These are tab-delimited ascii files.
- Permit Header: contains a primary index (Permit_Index).
- POD: contains a primary index (POD_Index)  This is tied back to the Permit Header table with the Permit_Index field
- Water Use: contains both the POD_Index and the Permit_Index for purposes of aggregating it back to either the POD or the Permit.


The Water Use data is tied (relationally) back to both the Permit Header and the POD tables.
The Permit Header table generally includes all of the data related to the permit, which includes general information about the permit holder total authorization, etc.  
Each permit can include one or many POD, which generally include all of the spatial data (i.e. location, source, etc.) as well as additional information related to any authorization specific to the POD.
So Water Use data can be summarized in a number of ways either back to the Permit Header, or the POD, or the Permit Header through the POD.
