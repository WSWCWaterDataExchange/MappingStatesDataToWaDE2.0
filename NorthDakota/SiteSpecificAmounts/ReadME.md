# CSWRCB Site Specific Data Preparation for WaDE
This readme details the process that was applied by the staff of the [Western States Water Council (WSWC)](http://wade.westernstateswater.org/) to extracting site specific time series water data made available by the [California State Water Resources Control Board (CSWRCB)](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/ewrims/), for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange (WaDE) project.  WaDE enables states to share data with each other and the public in a more streamlined and consistent way. WaDE is not intended to replace the states data or become the source for that data but rather to enable regional analysis to inform policy decisions and for planning purposes. 


## Overview of Data Utilized
The following data was used for timeseries site specific water data...

- [Delivered Water - Public System](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/drinking-water-public-water-system-annually-reported-water-production-and-delivery-information) time series data 2013-2016.
- [Public Water system Facilities](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/drinking-water-public-water-system-information) data.
- [California Drinking Water System Area Boundaries](https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/home/item.html?id=fbba842bf134497c9d611ad506ec48cc) data.


Unique files were created, one used by the WSWC staff to understand the available data (*"_with Notes"*), the second resulting files to be used as input to the Python codes that prepare WaDE2 input files.  Input files used are as follows...
 - deliveredPWS_2013_2016.csv
 - PWS Facility Information.csv
 - CADWS_AreaBoundaries.csv

## Summary of Data Prep
The following text summarizes the process used by the WSWC staff to prepare and share CSWRCB's site specific time series water data for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange (WaDE 2.0) project.  For a complete mapping outline, see *CA_SiteSpecificAmounts Schema Mapping to WaDE_QA.xlsx*.  Six executable code files were used to extract the state agency's site specific time series data from the above mentioned input files.  Each code file is numbered for order of operation.  The first code file (pre-process) was built and ran within [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), the remaining five code files were built and operated within [Pycharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The last code file *(SiteSpecificAmounts)* is dependent on the previous files.  Those six code files are as follows...

### 0) Code File: 0_PreProcessCASiteSpecificData.ipynb
Purpose: Pre-process the state agency input data files into one master file for simple DataFrames creation and extraction.

#### Inputs: 
 - deliveredPWS_2013_2016.csv
 - PWS Facility Information.csv
 - CADWS_AreaBoundaries.csv

#### Outputs:
 - P_caSSMaster.csv

#### Operation and Steps:
- Read in input csv data, place into temporary dataframes.
- Left join dataframes together.  Join *deliveredPWS_2013_2016.csv* -to- *PWS Facility Information.csv* via **PWSID** and **Water System No** respectively, and *CADWS_AreaBoundaries.csv* with **SABL_PWSID**.
- As a whole, there are 11 different timeseries that will be incorporated into the WaDE 2.0 architecture.  These timeseries differ by variable type, beneficial use, and water source typeâ€¦
    - for variable: Delivered or Produced
    - for beneficial use: Single Family Residential, Multi-Family Residential, Commercial Institutional, Industrial, Landscape Irrigation, Other, Agriculture, Other PWS, or Total Use
    - for water source type: Groundwater, Surface Water, or Unspecified
- For Delivered data, there are eight different timeseries of interest.  For each of eight data sets...
    - WaDE *VariableCV* field = "Delivered".
    - WaDE *WaterSourceTypeCV* field = "Unspecified".
    - WaDE *CoordinateMethodCV* field = "Centroid of Area.
    - WaDE *County* field = **COUNTY** input.

    - WaDE *BenUse* field = "Single Family Residential", "Multi Family Residential", "Commercial Institutional", "Industrial", "Landscape Irrigation", "Other", "Agricultural" &  "Other PWS" respectively.
    - WaDE *CommunityWaterSupplySystem* field = **Water.System.Name** input.
    - WaDE *CustomerTypeCV* field = **State Water System Type** input.
    - WaDE *PopulationServed* field = **Population Of Service Area** input.
    - *Year* = **Year** input.
    - *Month* = **Month** input.
    - *Days.In.Month* = **Days.In.Month** input.
    - Concatenate the eight different timeseries into a single long Delivered Data DataFrames.
    - Format WaDE *Amount* field, check for errors.
- For Produced data, there are three different timeseries of interest.  For each of three data sets...
    - WaDE *VariableCV* = "Produced".
    - WaDE *WaterSourceTypeCV* field = "Groundwater", "Surface Water", & "Purchased" respectively.
    - WaDE *CoordinateMethodCV* field = "Centroid of Area".
    - WaDE *County* field = **COUNTY** input.
    - WaDE *Latitude* field = **Lat** created from centroid of area using shapefile.
    - WaDE *Longitude* field = **Long** created from centroid of area using shapefile.
    - WaDE *PODorPOUSite* field = "POU".
    - WaDE *SiteName* field = **Water System Name** input.
    - WaDE *SiteNativeID* field = **SABL_PWSID** input.
    - WaDE *SiteTypeCV* field = **BOUNDARY_T** input.
    - *WaterUnits* = **WATER PRODUCED Water.Units REVIEWED BY OFFICE OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS** input.
    - WaDE *Amount* field = **WATER PRODUCED FROM GROUNDWATER**, **WATER PRODUCED FROM SURFACE WATER**, & **FINSIHIED WATER PURCHASED OR RECEIVED FROM ANOTHER PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM** inputs respectively.
    - WaDE *BenUse* = "Unspecified".
    - WaDE *CommunityWaterSupplySystem* field = **Water.System.Name** input.
    - WaDE *CustomerTypeCV* field = **State Water System Type** input.
    - WaDE *PopulationServed* field = **Population Of Service Area** input.
    - *Year* = **Year** input.
    - *Month* = **Month** input.
    - *Days.In.Month* = **Days.In.Month** input.
    - Concatenate the three different timeseries into a single long Produced Data DataFrames.
    - Convert WaDE *Amount* field using *WaterUnits* to convert to Gallons, check for errors.
- Concatenate Delivered Data DataFrames with Produced Data DataFrames.
- Create WaDE *TimeframeStart* field using *Year* and *Month* values.  Assume starting day is always "01".  Format to YYYY-MM_DD format.
- Create WaDE *TimeframeEnd* field using *Year*, *Month* & *Days.In.Month* values.  Format to YYYY-MM_DD format.
- Generate WaDE specific *TimeframeStart* & *TimeframeEnd* fields. Assume start date is 01/ + **Month** & **Year**,  and end date is 31/ + + **Month** & **Year**.
- Review for errors.
- Create WaDE Specific *WaterSourceNativeID* field using created *WaterSourceTypeCV* field, helps cut down on searching.
- Export output DataFrames as new csv file, *P_caSSMaster.csv*.
