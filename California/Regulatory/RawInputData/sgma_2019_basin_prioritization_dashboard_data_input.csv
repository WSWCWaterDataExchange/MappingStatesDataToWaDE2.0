2) Although the DWR has classified this area as being located within the Bodega Bay Groundwater Basin, information regarding this groundwater basin is limited. Groundwater is contained in generally thin terrace deposits and in fractures in the underlying Franciscan Assemblage rocks. The lack of a large storage volume in these aquifer materials limits the available water supply and subjects this area to water supply problems during successive dry years. Continued growth in areas of limited groundwater that also depends on groundwater can present supply problems to existing wells. In addition, the proximity of this basin to the ocean has lead to problems with saltwater intrusion (4.5-26).

Continued growth in areas of limited groundwater that also depends on groundwater can present supply problems to existing wells. In addition, the proximity of this basin to the ocean has lead to problems with saltwater intrusion (4.5-26).  The Bodega Bay community also has a salt water intrusion problem, and the Bodega Bay PUD is continuously battling saltwater intrusion in its wells that serve this unincorporated urban area (4.5-55).  Non-discretionary land use and development entitlements could result in seawater intrusion associated with agricultural well development, low density development, and urban development. However, the relatively low density allowed in these rural areas, coupled with the fact that the Bodega Bay Public Utility District was able to develop wells in areas not affected by saltwater intrusion, would reduce this impact to a less-than-significant level (4-5.56).

2) Alameda County Water District provides retail water supplies to the cities of Fremont, Newark, and Union City. The district has implemented treatment of brackish groundwater to allow previously unused groundwater to be used as a potable water source (ACWD 2011, 2012). In 2003, the Alameda County Water District Newark Desalination Facility began to remove salts and other constituents from the Niles Cone subbasin groundwater that is subject to seawater intrusion using a reverse-osmosis process.

Water-level declines of more than 200 ft occurred in the Santa Clara Valley from the early 1900's to the mid 1960's (Fowler, 1981). Land subsidence was first detected in 1933 (Poland and Ireland, 1988). As the decades passed, groundwater levels continued to decline and spirit-level surveys in 1967 identified subsidence of substantial magnitude as much as 8 feet.

The groundwater meets all drinking water standards and can be used without additional treatment (SCVWD 2001, 2010). Some areas affected by historical saltwater intrusion exist in the northern portion of the Santa Clara subbasin in the Shallow Aquifer especially near areas of historical subsidence. Recent groundwater monitoring has indicated that seawater intrusion appears to be stabilizing (SCVWD 2012a).

2) The Santa Clara Valley is located at the southern end of San Francisco Bay (fig. 111). Once devoted largely to agriculture, most of the land in the valley is now dedicated to industrial and urban uses. Population growth has resulted in a large water demand, which has exceeded the valley's natural supply since the early 1940's. Withdrawals of ground water in excess of recharge caused large water-level declines, which were followed by seawater intrusion and land subsidence surpassed in California only by that in the San Joaquin Valley. Since the 1940's, importation of surface water has been essential to the control of these problems.

This would be expected since the hydrostatic balance or equilibrium between fresh (1.000 grams/cubic centimeter [g/cm3]) and salt water (1.025 g/cm3) is one to forty (1:40) [1.000 / (1.025 - 1.000). Fresh water is lighter and tends to float on salt water. This means that if sufficient groundwater storage is available, then one-foot of fresh water above sea level at a well will have 40 feet of fresh water below sea level. This relationship is experienced on ocean islands and is referred to as the Ghyben-Herzberg lens (Todd, 1980).

The study identified approximately 900 AF of potential use in east San Rafael, on the San Quentin Peninsula, and the lower Ross Valley. The sewage collection system for CMSA has extensive and widespread saltwater intrusion that has increased dramatically since the initial planning for this project. ...The district has thoroughly explored ways to expand water recycling. ...Another obstacle to increased water recycling in the district’s service area is severe saltwater intrusion into the sewer collection systems of most of the local sanitation agencies, including that of the community’s largest wastewater agency, CMSA. Rehabilitation of the sewer collection system was explored, but intrusion is so widespread that the cost to repair the sewers is much more than the cost of the water recycling project. Reducing salt in wastewater using membrane processes has also been explored, but the high cost and increased concentration of contaminants remaining in the wastewater discharge render that alternative infeasible from both a cost and regulatory perspective.

Brackish water intrusions into the groundwater from tidal fluctuations are a main concern in the area around San Pablo Bay and can degrade groundwater quality (Cardwell, 1958 in DWR, 2004). In general, groundwater production for domestic uses within the basin is limited. (3.3-5)...

Despite extensive conservation efforts by customers, the Soquel-Aptos Area groundwater basin is in a state of overdraft because more water is being pumped out annually than is naturally recharged through rainfall. The groundwater basin is the SqCWD’s only source of water. Overdraft of the groundwater basin is not sustainable and  seawater intrusion at the coastline is present in the  Aptos, Seascape, and La Selva Beach area.

2) In July 2015 the Soquel-Valley Groundwater Basin was identified by the Department of Water Resources as one of 21 water basins to be reclassified as critically overdrafted. This was done on the basis of seawater intrusion detected at the coastline, and the declaration of a Groundwater Emergency by Soquel Creek Water District in 2014.

""Most recently, groundwater levels collected from PVWMA’s network of monitoring wells throughout the 2013 water year were used to map the water table elevation in the basin. It is evident that a significant trough below sea level still exists throughout the valley floor, centered around the Pajaro River channel.""  And  ""If drought conditions were to occur again with the basin in its current state, overdraft conditions would worsen and seawater intrusion rates would accelerate beyond what has been measured in the past.""
Source: 3-002.01_7a_BMPUpdateFinalFebruary 2014.pdf",0,No documented groundwater extraction induced inelastic Subsidence,5,"1) Seawater intrusion was first documented in the Pajaro Valley basin in 1953, and has continued since that time. Because the Pajaro Valley basin is in severe overdraft, groundwater levels have dropped below sea-level, allowing seawater to move into the aquifer. Seawater intrusion in the Pajaro Valley basin has been observed up to three miles inland, as shown in Figure 4 (PVWMA, 2014B). The current seawater intrusion rate in the Pajaro Valley is estimated to be 100 to 250 feet per year, and its effects already extend several miles inland (PVWMA, 2014A). ...In April 2014, the Pajaro Valley Water Management Agency Board of Directors adopted a Basin Management Plan update. The plan proposes six projects and an aggressive conservation program that will reduce groundwater over pumping by 90% and essentially halt seawater intrusion into the Pajaro Valley Aquifer (PVWMA, 2014B).

2)  Today, the need to abate groundwater overdraft and prevent further seawater intrusion into the coastal aquifer drives the PVWMA’s conjunctive use and groundwater management program. Beginning in the early 1990s, the PVWMA started establishing a water supply system that today combines surface, groundwater, and recycled water to sustain valley farms and work to recharge declining groundwater aquifers. The Agency still has much to do, and in its ongoing basin management planning efforts, is working alongside university researchers, as well as with local stakeholder groups to develop the most cost-effective and efficient programs and projects.

2) GWLs continued to decline in areas of basin that rely on GW, specifically in the former Bolsa, San Juan, Hollister West, Bolsa SE, and Tres Pinos subbasins. While some subbasins showed groundwater level increases, overall groundwater in storage decreased. Groundwater elevation declines and storage decreases during drought do not constitute overdraft; nevertheless, the continued reduced supplies of imported water in tandem with increased groundwater demands are a warning of potential overdraft.

4) The Basin Plan established two methods for measuring progress in management of seawater intrusion (ISJ Group, 2015): one based on comparing annual groundwater extractions with the sustainable yield of the basin as calculated by the basin numerical groundwater model, and one based on evaluating water level and water quality data from the LOBP Groundwater Monitoring Program. ...The Chloride Metric is defined as the weighted average concentration of chlorides in four key Lower Aquifer wells. One key well (LA10) is within the historical path of seawater intrusion (Cleath & Associates, 2005). Reduction in pumping from the Lower Aquifer should result in measurable declines in chloride concentrations at this well, as the hydraulic head in the Lower Aquifer increases and the hydraulic gradient toward land decreases or reversed. The LOBP Groundwater Monitoring Program schedule for measuring the Chloride metric is in the Spring and Fall. There are also three key wells on the perimeter of the seawater intrusion front (LA8, LA11, and LA12).

2) The importation of State Water, which is generally of better quality than the local sources, provides for higher quality “return flows” and thus improves the basin water quality. In addition to improvements provided by the operations of Twitchell Reservoir and State Water importation, the Laguna Sanitation District helps to improve water quality in the basin by utilizing a reverse osmosis process to remove, and a deep injection well to dispose of, approximately 8,000 pounds of salts per day, which would otherwise accumulate in the basin system. With the deep injection system these salts stay far below the aquifer and are not a threat to return to the aquifer.  ...Salt Water Intrusion: Coastal monitoring wells are measured biannually for any indication of seawater intrusion; to date there has been no evidence of such. The concern of seawater intrusion is based on evidence that the Careaga Sand outcrops on the ocean floor several miles west and there are no Coast-Known barriers to seawater intrusion. Although it is possible that the seawater-fresh water interface has migrated shoreward during drought periods, the slope of groundwater has remained to the west in the westernmost part of the basin.

2) USGS 2013-5108: Interpretations indicate that both elastic and inelastic compaction occurred in the basin... The cyclic variability in the daily land surface position in the lateral and vertical directions for CUHS indicated the aquifer sediments in the area had experienced elastic deformation. However, a longer-term downward trend likely represents inelastic deformation and indicates reduced storage capacity in the aquifer sediments. In 2011, motion in all the directions increased substantially and corresponded to compression of the aquifer sediments. The cyclic variation in the position of the land surface at CUHS also correlated with water-level measurements in nearby wells, which supports the conclusion that elastic deformation was caused by groundwater withdrawals.

The highest TDS concentration (3,780 mg/l) was found in the extreme western end of the Valley and westward of the Barka Slough; the lowest concentration (263 mg/l) was found at the extreme eastern end. Analyses compiled for samples taken between 1958 and 1978 indicate that groundwater quality remained fairly stable during that period. Analyses of water sampled in 1993 for several wells show only slight increases since the previous study. There is evidence that poor quality connate waters exist within fracture zones of the bedrock and that this water might be induced into overlying strata, especially west of Barka Slough. There is no evidence of seawater intrusion in the basin, nor is the basin considered susceptible to seawater intrusion due to the consolidated rock that separates the basin from the ocean.

2) This basin is not subject to overdraft (i.e. a progressive long-term drop in water levels) because the average annual flow to the Santa Ynez River (the main recharge source) is greater than the volume of the basin.

2) Upon crossing into Section 35 West in the far western section of the Lompoc Plain water quality changes dramatically. In this area, near the coast, groundwater from the main zone exhibited TDS concentrations as high as 4,500 mg/l. Water quality in the shallow zone of the Lompoc Plain tends to be poorest near the coast and in some heavily irrigated areas of the area. TDS concentrations of up to 8,000 mg/l near the coast were measured in the late 1980s. Contamination of the main zone near the coast is thought to be due to percolation of seawater through estuary lands and upward migration of poor quality connate waters from the underlying rock. The presence of elevated boron, a constituent common in seawater supports this conclusion. ...In addition, the Santa Ynez River Water Conservation District coordinates both water level and water quality measurements at 16 sites in the Lompoc area funded by local water purveyors and the County as part of the ongoing monitoring in relation to operations of Lake Cachuma.

2) Chloride concentrations are a particular problem in low lying areas of the basin near tidal marshes. While high chloride concentrations are one indication of seawater intrusion, observation wells near the Goleta Slough area also exhibited correspondingly high concentrations of sulfate, a mineral not normally found in significant quantities in seawater (SBCWA, 1977). There is currently no evidence of seawater intrusion. In addition, seawater intrusion is not likely to have occurred at any time due to the rock formations and the More Ranch Fault along the coast which act as barriers to groundwater migration. Near surface, low permeability sediments cause the southern portion of the Central, North and West Sub-basins to be under confined conditions. These sediments provide a barrier to potential surface sources of water quality degradation such as agricultural return flow or infiltration of brackish water in the overlying Goleta Slough. In some areas high TDS perched water is present in shallow aquifers above the confining layers. This water is not in general use.

2) It is noted that during this 10-year period since 1998 (i.e.,1999 through 2008), the annual average rainfall was 16.8 inches, which is approximately 15 percent less than the longterm annual average of 19.8 inches. During this period, however, annual groundwater pumping averaged only approximately 3,600 afy, which is approximately 20 to 30 percent less than the previous estimates of basin yield that range between 4,500 to 5,000 afy. The observation that water levels gradually declined under these conditions of recharge and pumping suggests that previous estimates of basin yield may have been overestimated. The results of the change in groundwater storage calculations are summarized below:
Fall 1984 through Fall 1991: 15,988 acre-feet of storage depletion;
Fall 1991 through Spring 1998: 17,661 acre-feet storage increase;
Spring 1998 through Fall 2008: 5,879 acre-feet of storage depletion.

2) According to the 2012 Master Water Report, the basin yield is estimated to be 120 AFY (Cleath, 1986). Contamination of water supply wells due to seawater intrusion is a major water quality concern in the basin (Cleath, 1986). Lowering of groundwater levels below sea level in the basin during the summer months when creek flows are absent and pumping is active can result in the landward migration of the sea water/fresh groundwater interface. Since at least the mid-1980s, sea water intrusion has occurred within the Pico Creek Valley Groundwater Basin (San Simeon Valley) (Cleath, 1986). Seawater intrusion occurs routinely and increases chloride levels above secondary drinking water standards.

Recent basin TDS concentrations (measured in 2008) are typically between 500 and 700 mg/L (DWR 1975; Cleath-Harris Geologists, 2009).  Constraints on  groundwater availability in this basin include physical limitations, water quality issues, environmental demand, and water rights. In the Chorro Valley upstream of the Chorro Creek discharge point for the California Men’s Colony wastewater treatment plant, water level and well capacity declines during drought continue to limit the availability of the resource. The wastewater plant discharges enter the basin as imported water sources, and therefore provide additional available water for basin wells and environmental demand below the discharge point. In the lower valley area, sea water intrusion is the primary constraint, especially during drought conditions. The elevated nitrates are a constraint for drinking water availability at the City of Morro Bay well field where production is also limited by appropriative water right permits from the State Board. These permits for underflow production by the City of Morro Bay have also been conditioned to require minimum surface flows in Chorro Creek for Steelhead habitat protection.

2) In 2011, the MWD obtained approximately 82% of its water from the Santa Ynez River System, 4% from the State Water Project, 11% from Doulton Tunnel intrusion and relied on the Montecito Groundwater Basin for 3% of its yearly production needs.  Review of water quality for recently tested MWD wells shows no quality degradation when compared to previous years. Studies also indicate that seawater intrusion is not a significant problem in the basin. It is thought that deeper aquifers of the basin are protected from seawater intrusion by an impermeable offshore fault. However, some encroachment of seawater might occur in shallower aquifers during periods of heavy pumping such as during the early 1960s.

2) Demand on the basin falls into three categories: pumpage by the City of Santa Barbara (City), pumpage by the La Cumbre Mutual Water Company (LCMWC) and extractions by private landowners. Pumpage of the basin was at its maximum around 1950 at 2,400 AFY and during that time the basin water levels dropped substantially but have since recovered with the introduction of other water sources. The City has historically injected and stored surface water in the basin but has reduced the practice in recent years. The City and LCMWC account for about 80% of basin pumpage and with the active management of the basin by the City and LCMWC, the Foothill Basin is considered not to be in overdraft. Analyses of water from these wells indicated general water quality to be classified as very hard with dissolved solids, chloride, sodium, and sulfate all equaling or exceeding secondary standards in most wells sampled. Nitrate (reported as nitrate plus nitrite or total nitrogen) exceeded primary drinking water standards in two of the eight wells sampled. TDS concentrations were relatively high, ranging from 610 to 1,000 ppm in seven wells sampled in the basin. Chloride concentrations in this basin were relatively low (44 to 130 ppm) in the seven wells (Freckleton, 1989). Note that an eighth well was sampled in the USGS study from which poor quality water (TDS 1,900 ppm, chloride 360 ppm) was recovered. This well, however, is known to produce water from bedrock aquifers below the sediments that comprise the Foothill Basin.

2) In the Ojai Valley, the water level elevation in key Well No. 04N22W05L08S was down 50.2 feet from the 2013 measurement after having been down 78.4 feet from the 2012 measurement. The Ojai Valley basin responds quickly to rainfall or the lack of rainfall, and it is not uncommon to see large drops in water level during dry periods and recovery to at or above normal levels during wet periods (see Hydrograph in Appendix B).

2) There is evidence for the occurrence of long-term overdraft in at least two of the groundwater basins of the District. Groundwater levels have generally been declining for periods of several decades in the Oxnard Plain and Pleasant Valley basins. While the factors causing declining groundwater trends may have varied among these two basins, long-term replenishment rates have not kept up with long-term withdrawal rates in either of them. Thus, these basins are considered by the District to be in a condition of long-term overdraft.
Source: 4-004.02_7a_2016GWConditionsReportFINAL.pdf  pg. 12",3,"1)  Water-level declines in the basin have induced land subsidence that was first measured in 1939 and have resulted in as much as 2.7 feet land subsidence in the southern part of the Oxnard Plain. The model simulated a total of 3 feet of land subsidence in the southern part of the Oxnard Plain and as much as 5 feet in the Las Posas Valley subbasins. Model simulations indicate that most of the land subsidence occurred after the drought of the late 1920s and during the agricultural expansion of the 1950s and 1960s. The results also indicate that subsidence occurred primarily in the upper-aquifer system prior to 1959, but in the lower-aquifer system between 1959-93 owing to an increase in pumpage from the lower-aquifer system.

Rising groundwater levels in the Las Posas Valley are a result of active management to increase groundwater recharge beneath the Arroyo Las Posas. Seawater intrusion began in the Oxnard Plain area by 1930s and was widespread as early as the 1940s. Changes in groundwater management, including pumping reductions, shifting of pumping locations, construction of the Freeman Diversion, and the operation of the Pumping Trough and Pleasant Valley pipeline systems have significantly reduced seawater intrusion, but seawater intrusion conditions persist.

In addition to the Ventura County General Plan, Hazards Appendix, that identified Fillmore and Piru basins as being in an area of probable subsidence, the 1996 USGS Open-File Report 96-517 discussed non-tectonic deformation and subsidence in the Piru and Fillmore area.  The USGS (1996) report indicated that 60 mm of non-tectonic subsidence occurred between 1975 and 1978.  Between 1975 and 1989, about 1.5 cm was identified in the same area, suggesting that aquifer recharge occurred and that the ground surface elevation somewhat rebounded.  Because subsidence was identified and the rebound was not complete, a small amount of non-tectonic subsidence was interpreted by the USGS to have occurred between 1975 and 1989.  Although most of the 60 mm of observed subsidence appeared to be elastic, the potential for subsidence exists.

Misc. - Indirect evidence of subsidence related to groundwater withdrawal, groundwater level declines greater than 30m, subsurface collapse of well casings, and repeated re-leveling of irrigated fields ",5,"Although groundwater levels in the Oxnard Plain area (Mound, Oxnard, Santa Paula, Pleasant Valley, & Las Posas Valley) have been relatively stable or have shown an increasing trend, in the coastal regions this stability is largely due to seawater intrusion and results in water of unusable quality replacing high quality groundwater. Rising groundwater levels in the Las Posas Valley are a result of active management to increase groundwater recharge beneath the Arroyo Las Posas. Seawater intrusion began in the Oxnard Plain area by 1930s and was widespread as early as the 1940s. Changes in groundwater management, including pumping reductions, shifting of pumping locations, construction of the Freeman Diversion, and the operation of the Pumping Trough and Pleasant Valley pipeline systems have significantly reduced seawater intrusion, but seawater intrusion conditions persist.

The model simulated a total of 3 feet of land subsidence in the southern part of the Oxnard Plain and as much as 5 feet in the Las Posas Valley subbasins. Model simulations indicate that most of the land subsidence occurred after the drought of the late 1920s and during the agricultural expansion of the 1950s and 1960s. The results also indicate that subsidence occurred primarily in the upper-aquifer system prior to 1959, but in the lower-aquifer system between 1959-93 owing to an increase in pumpage from the lower-aquifer system.

If the city were to over-pump from wells, it’s possible to reverse the natural water flow and actually pull seawater from the ocean into the local ground- water supply. Such seawater intrusion can occur for other reasons such as climate change or drilling new wells too close to salt water sources. To the best of the City’s knowledge, no such contamination has occurred in recent memory but it is assumed contamination could have, and probably did, occur at some point in the City’s history. Historic records are incomplete but city wells in the Marine Park area were contaminated and abandoned in the 1930s due to salt water intrusion. Experts have concluded that Lincoln Boulevard is the boundary for any potential salt water intrusion and therefore the western edge of the city’s underground water supply.

2) The areas of continuing overdraft in the County cover most of the Lower Cache-Putah and western Colusa sub-basins. To some extent improvements from reduced pumping have occurred in the DWD area of Colusa sub-basin. Particular overdraft spots include the Yolo-Woodland area on both sides of Cache Creek, areas between Zamora and Yolo, and areas to the northeast of Davis. These areas coincide with places where subsidence and/or deteriorating groundwater quality have been measured.

3) Water levels are declining and chloride concentrations are increasing in western San Joaquin County as a result of pumping in excess of recharge.
Source: 5-022.01_7a_SanJoaquinChlorides.pdf",10,Source: 2016 - Various_7b_NASA_REPORT_2016.pdf,5,"1) In the Eastern San Joaquin subbasin, the groundwater is characterized with low to high salinity levels and localized areas of high calcium or magnesium bicarbonate, salinity, nitrates, pesticides, and organic constituents (DWR 2006j, 2013b). The high groundwater salinity is attributed to poor-quality groundwater intrusion from the Delta caused by the pumping-induced decline in groundwater levels, especially in the groundwater underlying the Stockton area since the 1970s (SJCFCWCD 2008). (pg. 7-34)  The east side of the San Joaquin River is underlain by seven groundwater subbasins: the Cosumnes, Eastern San Joaquin, Modesto, Turlock, Merced, Chowchilla, and Madera subbasins. ...Declining groundwater levels in the subbasins east of the San Joaquin River have resulted in an area approximately 16-miles long with high salinity due to saltwater intrusion from the Delta (USFWS 2012).

2) In the Eastern San Joaquin Groundwater Subbasin, near Stockton, California, 130 km east of San Francisco (Fig. 1), pumping in excess of recharge and resulting declines in water levels within aquifers to below sea level has led to an increase in chloride concentrations in water from wells (Izbicki et al. 2006). This trend began in the 1950s and has led to exceedances of the USEPA secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) of 250 mg/L for chloride in several wells (DWR 1967). In an effort to mitigate the impact of high-chloride water on groundwater supplies, local agencies, led by the Eastern San Joaquin County Groundwater Basin Authority in cooperation with the DWR, Stockton East Water District, and the City of Stockton, implemented strategies involving the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater to meet demand. ...Artificial recharge programs have also been implemented that promote infiltration of captured local runoff to manage declining water levels and chloride concentrations. Programs include Stockton East Water District’s Farmington Groundwater Recharge Program, with a goal of recharging about 43×106 m3 /year annually through field-flooding (Stockton East Water District 2014) and the City of Stockton’s Morada Recharge Facility, which utilizes an existing stormflow basin to infiltrate local surface water and stormflow runoff (O’Leary et al. 2012).

2) Overdraft was estimated to average 143,000 AF/year over the period from 1980-2011. Future overdraft (2014 and beyond) is estimated to be 259,000 AF/year. The increase in overdraft can be attributed primarily to increased cropping, maturation of existing tree crops, and impacts from the San Joaquin River Restoration.

2) The region faces many water management challenges including groundwater overdraft,
surface water shortages in dry years, and groundwater quality problems in certain
areas. Groundwater overdraft is generally considered the largest regional problem with
the current plan area overdraft estimated to be 100,000 to 150,000 AF/year. The longterm
decline in groundwater storage will be significant if current water management
strategies are maintained. Correcting the overdraft through regional efforts will help
lead to overall maintenance and improvement in the quantity, quality and cost of
development of groundwater resources in the region.

Even though over 3 million acre-feet of surface water has been imported into the District over the past 30 years in an effort to supplement local surface water supply and reduce dependence on groundwater, the average depth to groundwater within the Plan Area has continued to drop.

Salts are imported into the Tulare Lake Area through irrigation with Delta water and salts added through application of fertilizers, and other salt containing materials. Except in very wet years, the Tulare Lake Area has no natural drainage, so imported salts accumulate in the groundwater unless captured and sequestered. This salt accumulation causes groundwater quality degradation for potable and agricultural uses.   ....To the high nitrate and salinity problems, the Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-Term Sustainability (CV-Salts) was formed as a strategic initiative to address accumulation of salts and nitrates throughout the region in a comprehensive, consistent and sustainable manner (CVRWQCB 2015; SWRCB 2015).

2) Technical studies show that current salinity management activities may only address about 15% of the annual salt load in the Central Valley Region. Accordingly, long?term solutions, including development of regional de?salters, a regulated brine line, or other projects that would allow containment or removal of salt, are needed to address the other 85%. These long?term management solutions will require significant state and federal funding to implement.

3) Some of the most advanced salt management techniques Coast-Known are being employed in the Central Valley to manage salt in the Tulare Lake Basin and other areas in the San Joaquin Valley. These solutions include: On-farm water reuse and salt precipitation, Reverse osmosis concentration and truck disposal to existing ocean outfalls, Brine reinjection into oil extraction areas, Water management and source water replacement, Current source control for salts going into the domestic sewers.

2) On May 16, 2014, Geologic staff visited the project site and measured the depth to water in 17 wells on the project site. Geologic also reviewed a Department of Water Resources (DWR) water level database and found that water level elevations in a number of wells in Panoche Valley have declined over the last 5 years by approximately 5 to 15 feet. However, water level elevations in other wells within the Panoche Valley have risen during the same period.

Trace levels of PCE below MCLs is presently detected in one PSW well (TKWC#1); however, PCE concentrations have been steadily increasing in this well during the 2016 WY. Potential impairment of TKWC #1 would further reduce the total production capacity of the area drinking water sources by an additional 1.44 MGD. Two other wells (LBWC #1 and TKWC #3) west of the South ""Y"" plume are presently non-detect for PCE; however, the combined source capacity of these two neighboring wells is 3.82 MGD and is believed to be at risk for groundwater contamination in the future. This a major challenge for the management of groundwater resources of the basin. Competition for funding and resources for containment/clean-up and a slow but increasing reduction in groundwater storage due to plume expansion puts increasing pressures on sustainability.

2) Troy Lake/Newberry Springs - Land surface subsided a maximum of about 50 mm (1.96 in.) at an average rate of about 9 mm/yr. (0.35 in./yr.) on and adjacent to the western and southern shores of Troy Lake near Newberry Springs from July 2004 to November 2009 (fig. 5A). Subsidence here represents a local maximum of a larger area, with smaller magnitude deformation extending north to the Mojave River and as far west as the Barstow Daggett County Airport. The larger-area subsidence was negligible in individual interferograms; however, stacked interferograms exhibiting the cumulative change showed as much as 10 mm (0.39 in.) of localized subsidence from July 2004 to November 2009 (Central Stack B, July 19, 2004, to November 30, 2009). In addition to the maximum subsidence at Troy Lake, land surface subsided about 25 mm (0.98 in.), at an average rate of nearly 5 mm/yr. (0.20 in./yr.), from July 2004 to November 2009 at Newberry Springs; subsidence at this location was reported previously (Sneed and others, 2003; Stamos and others, 2007).

The results included an increase in the extent of inland flooding, damaged engineered infrastructure, and the sudden appearance and erosional enlargement of destructive earth fissures, which have become permanent features of the landscape.

2) Estimates of pumping in 2005 are in the 110-120K AF. 2012 was 90K AF. Court Adjudicated;  Prior to 1972, groundwater provided more than 90 percent of the total water supply in the valley; since 1972, it has provided between 50 and 90 percent;  Nearly four feet of land subsidence at Edwards Air Force Based between 1926 and 1992.  From 1990 to 2000, nearly 0.4 feet of subsidence (Sneed and Galloway, 2000).  Fissures range from one inch to over one foot wide and can be as long as 700 feet.

If irreversible subsidence was found to occur in a localized area in relation to groundwater pumping patterns or groundwater storage conditions, OCWD would coordinate with local officials to investigate and develop an approach to address the subsidence.""   OCWD also avoids exceeding the safe yield to reduce the chances of inelastic subsidence.

Real time monitoring network ""consists of continuously operating GPS reference stations that monitor horizontal and vertical movement throughout Orange County.""  ""GPS data collected by the Surveyor over the past 12 years (2002-2014) show that the ground surface fluctuations appear to be completely elastic, reversible, and well correlated with fluctuations in groundwater levels.  The ""data indicate that there has NOT been any permanent, irreversible subsidence of the ground surface over the past 12 years.""

Subsidence began as early as 1898; groundwater storage conditions were at historical lows in the late 1950s.  ""More recent data show a consistent pattern of the ground surface rising and falling in tandem with groundwater levels and overall changes in basin groundwater storage.""

Lofgren (1976) measured compaction of aquifer materials with a 377-m deep extensometer from 1970 to 1974 and concluded that inelastic compaction of aquifer materials in the depth range of the extensometer amounted to about 1 cm /yr (0.04 ft/yr) and that tectonic subsidence amounted to 0.3-0.6 cm/yr (0.1-0. 2 in/yr). That is, most permanent subsidence (70-80 percent) resulted from groundwater withdrawal, with the remainder from tectonic downwarping of the valley.

2) There is always concern about Coast-Potential seawater intrusion into the Base wells resulting from water extraction exceeding the safe yield of the individual basins. For instance, by 1952 the Ysidora Narrows well in the Santa Margarita River basin showed evidence of seawater advance as far as 3-miles upstream due to pumping in the basin (California Department of Water Resources 1956). However, frequent monitoring and extraction control of key sentinel wells appears to have helped prevent such contamination from occurring in recent years. By maintaining a five-foot static water level at this critical well site, seawater intrusion has apparently been avoided (Leedshill-Herkenhoff 1989).

Delivery of imported water into the San Luis Rey Valley Groundwater Basin began after completion of the first San Diego Aqueduct in 1947; the introduction of imported water into the basin led to reduced groundwater pumping, which over time, has reduced groundwater pumping and allowed groundwater levels to recover to historical levels. Water importation has also reduced impacts associated with seawater intrusion. ...As it sits at the terminus of the San Luis Rey Valley Groundwater Basin and is therefore the first to be impacted by seawater intrusion, the City of Oceanside has actively pursued groundwater sustainability in the proposed Mission Sub-basin in order to protect an important part of its water supply system. The City has used a combination of imported surface water and recycled water to offset groundwater demands, and closely monitors both groundwater levels and quality to ensure the continued sustainability of this supply.

2) Ground-water quality within the alluvium has deteriorated as a result of seawater intrusion, intrusion of ground water from surrounding marine sedimentary rock, and changes in natural recharge patterns. Currently, the aquifer is of limited value as a water supply, and dissolved-solids concentrations typically exceed the basin objective of 1,000 mg/L and may exceed 5,000 mg/L. Application of large quantities of reclaimed water may, in time, improve water quality within the aquifer and increase its usefulness.

2) The alluvium within the San Elijo hydrologic subarea is not a water-supply source and presently is of limited value because of water-quality problems. Dissolved-solids concentrations exceed the basin objective of 1,000 mg/L, and concentrations of chloride and sulfate are greater than EPA drinking water standards of 250 mg/L. Reclaimed water use is undesirable because ground-water levels are at or near land surface much of the year.
