## USGS POU Site Specific Data

## Data structure

The table SiteVariableAmounts_fact.csv includes water use time series data and metadata that are referenced in other tables: sites.csv, variables.csv, methods.csv, and organizations.csv. WaterSources.csv provides further metadata to the sites.csv table. The PODSite_POUSite_Fact.csv table provides how the Points of Use (POU) are related to the Points of Diversions (POD) in the sites table.

**Note1**: For Utah POU sites, the WaDE team calculated their long. and lat. coordinates from the centroid of their polygon. 

**Note2**: California only has geospatial polygons that are assoicated with their POD and POU datasets. We calculated the centroid and used the same coordinates for POD and POU sites, until we have better data.
