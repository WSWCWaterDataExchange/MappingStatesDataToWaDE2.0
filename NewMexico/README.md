# WaDE Preparation

This repository stores code and data for California water allocations data made available by the [California State Water Resources Control Board (CSWRCB) eWRIMS – Electronic Water Rights Information Management System](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/ewrims/) and water use data made available by the [California Department of Water Resources (CDWR)](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/water-plan-water-balance-data) for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange version 2 (WaDE 2). For more information on WaDE, please visit http://wade.westernstateswater.org/

### Overview 
The WaDE 2 organizes data into four specific groups: 

**1. AggregatedAmounts**

**2. Regulatory**

**3. SiteSpecificAmounts**

**4. WaterAllocation**

The data and code for preparation of each group of inputs to WaDE are put into these four directories.
