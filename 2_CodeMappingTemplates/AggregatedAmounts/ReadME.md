# North Dakota Aggregated Data Preparation for WaDE
This readme details the process that was applied by the staff of the [Western States Water Council (WSWC)](http://wade.westernstateswater.org/) to extracting aggregated water budget data made available by the [North Dakota Department of Water Resources (NDDWR)](https://www.swc.nd.gov/), for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange (WaDE) project.   WaDE enables states to share data with each other and the public in a more streamlined and consistent way.  WaDE is not intended to replace the states data or become the source for that data but rather to enable regional analysis to inform policy decisions and for planning purposes. 

## Overview of Data Utilized
The following data was used for water allocations...

Name | Description | Download Link | Metadata Glossary Link
---------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------
**WATER USE REPORT_Basin_use_20230829.csv** | Timeseries report information for withdrawal area. | [link](https://www.swc.nd.gov/info_edu/map_data_resources/waterpermits/waterusereport.php) , Group by "Basin" and SubGroup by "Use Type" | Not Provided
**drb147.shp** | Geometry and location information saved within a shapefile. Joined to timeseries report information. | See *Download GIS files of 147 watersheds in the DRB (sub-basins) (zip 3 MB)* option, [link](https://www.nj.gov/drbc/programs/supply/use-demand-projections2060.html) | not provided


## Storage for WaDE 2.0 Source and Processed Water Data
The 1) raw input data shared by the state / state agency / data provider (excel, csv, shapefiles, PDF, etc), & the 2) csv processed input data ready to load into the WaDE database, can both be found within the WaDE sponsored Google Drive.  Please contact WaDE staff if unavailable or if you have any questions about the data.

## Summary of Data Prep
The following text summarizes the process used by the WSWC staff to prepare and share ND's aggregated water budget data for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange (WaDE 2.0) project.  For a complete mapping outline, see *NDag_Aggregated Schema Mapping to WaDE.xlsx*.  Several WaDE csv input files will be created in order to extract the water rights data from the above mentioned input.  Each of these WaDE csv input files was created using the [Python](https://www.python.org/) native language, built and ran within [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) environment.  Those python files include the following...

- **1_NDag_PreProcessAggregatedData.ipynb**: used to pre-processes the native date into a WaDE format friendly format.  All datatype conversions occur here.
- **2_NDag_CreateWaDEInputFiles.ipynb**: used to create the WaDE input csv files: methods.csv, variables.csv, organizations.csv, watersources.csv, reportingunits.csv, aggregatedamounts.csv
- **3_NDag_WaDEDataAssessmentScript.ipynb**: used to evaluate the WaDE input csv files.

## Code File: 2_NDag_CreateWaDEInputFiles.ipynb
Purpose: Pre-process the input data files and merge them into one master file for simple dataframe creation and extraction.

#### Inputs: 
 - WATER USE REPORT_Basin_use_20230829.csv
 - HUC8_Subbasin.shp

#### Outputs:

#### Operation and Steps:
- Read in the timeseries and shapefile input files. 
- Fill in assumed data in csv file for "Basin" and "Use Type".
- Remove all rows that are displaying column names.
- Left-join shapefile info to timeseries info of csv file via **Basin** input value and shp file via **NAME**.
- Generate WaDE specific field *WaterSourceNativeID* from WaDE *WaterSourceTypeCV* field.  Used to identify unique sources of water.
- Inspect output dataframe for additional errors / datatypes.
- Export main timeseries output dataframe as new csv file, *Pag_ndMain.zip*.
- Export related shapefile geometry information, *P_Geometry.zip*.
