# 2_CodeMappingTemplates
This fold contains templates [Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts and files used to map out data into the WaDE 2.0 system.  Scripts are operated in either the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) or [Pycharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows) coding environments.

The following templates are prepared at this time...
- **WaterAllocation**: used to map out water right (i.e. water allocation) information. Contains the following file info...
  - Empty folders to hold specific files.  **RawInputData** for raw file data straight from the data provider.  **ProcessedInputData** for processed WaDE upload csv files from the creation script.  **DataAssessment** for data assessment analytics and reports on the processed WaDE upload csv files
  - Creation scripts (pre-processing script, WaDE upload file creation script, data assessment script)
  - Mapping xlsx file to store relevant information on the raw data (i.e., the raw file data straight from the data provider) and how the raw data will fit into the WaDE 2.0 system and database.
  - ReadME file template used to convey relevant information on how the raw data was mapped into the WaDE 2.0 system and database.
