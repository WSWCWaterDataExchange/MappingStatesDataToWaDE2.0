            <abstract>The Point of Diversion feature class is a complete record of point of diversion locations taken from the Division's day to day operating database. The database is a complete record with the following exceptions:1) The Division's point of diversion referencing policy includes a provision which allows some point of diversion locations to be described more as areas (Point-to-Point Filings) than discrete points. Point to point filings are usually limited to stock watering rights. They are representedÂ  by a discrete point which is located within the area covered by the point to point description.2) Utah State Law required applications to divert surface water to be filed with the State Engineer after 1903 and groundwater after 1935. There may be existing diversions which began prior to those dates which are not included in the Division of Water Right records. The Division becomes aware of these rights and includes these rights in it's records when the user submits a statement of water user claim either pursuant to an adjudication or to establish there is a water right under which the State Engineer is to take action.3) Data in the Division of Water Rights database was entered over an eight year period from paper files maintained by the office. Data entered in the database has been subsequently verified by staff. However, errors are occasionally detected in the database as a result of entry operations either from current staff activities or the original entry project. The Division makes an ongoing effort to maintain the database free of errors and omissions, however users of the data are responsible to verify it is suitable for their purpose. The Division appreciates and encourages users to promptly disclose any inconsistencies detected in the data to Division staff who will make every effort to correct any errors discovered.</abstract>

ABANDONED WELL: well whose purpose and use have been permanently discontinued.
DRAIN: Excess collection/control system (surface or groundwater) from which a point of diversion maybe established
POINT TO POINT: Point To Point diversions are not developed points of diversion. The reference is to a stream segment from which stock may drink. Often designated in 40 acre parcels.
REDIVERSION: Diversion point, which diverts water which was previously diverted and released upstream. Usually associated with reservoir storage.
RETURN: Point where water that has been non-consumptively used is returned back to the natural stream.
SPRING: Concentrated discharge of ground water coming out at the surface as flowing water
SURFACE: Streams, rivers, creeks, any water above ground
UNDERGROUND: Wells, tunnels, sumps, and undgrd drains</attrdef>
