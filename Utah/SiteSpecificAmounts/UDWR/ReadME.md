Adam Clark summarized: 
*The spatial database is a combination of work and collaboration between the Div of Water Resources, Div of Water Rights, and the Div of Drinking Water.  Water Resources is the data steward/creator, but receives input from the other divisions on systems.  Water Rights and Drinking Water both maintain separate non-spatial databases of water systems.  Water Rights is mostly focused on water usage and sources, while Drinking Water is more focused on compliance and water quality.

*While all three databases share attributes in some ways, they differ in others.  If you were to join them, you would find that the number of systems differs between all three.  Our spatial database that you mentioned is our master database that includes all systems, past and present, that we have collected spatial data about.  It also includes large and small systems, non-public systems, and self-supplied industry.  You will find three columns of system IDs, because all three divisions use different ID systems for tracking/updating.  You can think of the spatial database as a bridge or hybrid between the other two.

*Feel free to use Water Rights' query service to get more information on systems.  Just realize that it will not have information on all of the systems included in the spatial database.  Water Rights uses our feature service in their website to show boundaries for systems, but I guarantee that many of the systems in the service are not used.
