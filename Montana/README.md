# Mapping Montana State Water Rights and Use Data To WaDE2.0

This repository stores code and data for Montana water rights and uses data made available by the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (MTDNRC) for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange version 2 (WaDE2). For more information on WaDE, please visit http://wade.westernstateswater.org/

Overview
The WaDE2 organizes data into four specific groups:

1. AggregatedAmounts

2. Regulatory

3. SiteSpecificAmounts

4. WaterAllocation

The data and code for preparation of each group of inputs to WaDE are put into these four directories.

# Structure
Each folder is for a unique data type that the state shares into WaDE 2.0. It contains 
1) the raw input data shared by the state (excel, csv, shapefiles,PDF, etc)
2) the processed input data into CSV files ready to load into WaDE database
3) the python scripts that process the raw input files and prepare the CSV files
