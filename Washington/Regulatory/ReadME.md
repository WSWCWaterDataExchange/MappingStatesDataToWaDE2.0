# WaDE Preparation
This repository stores code and data for the state of Washington regulatory data. For more information on WaDE, please visit http://wade.westernstateswater.org/

### Overview 
The WaDE 2 organizes data into four specific groups: 

**1. AggregatedAmounts**

**2. Regulatory**
- Washington Department of Ecology
- Washington Department of Natural Resources

**3. SiteSpecificAmounts**

**4. WaterAllocation**

The data and code for preparation of each group of inputs to WaDE are put into these four directories. 

# Structure
Each folder is for a unique data type that the state shares into WaDE 2.0. It contains 
1) the raw input data shared by the state (excel, csv, shapefiles,PDF, etc)
2) the processed input data into CSV files ready to load into WaDE database
3) the python scripts that process the raw input files and prepare the CSV files
