# WaDE Preparation

This repository stores code and data for Washington water allocations and water use data made available by the [Washington State Department of Ecology (WSDE)](https://ecology.wa.gov/Water-Shorelines/Water-supply/Water-rights) for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange version 2 (WaDE 2). For more information on WaDE, please visit http://wade.westernstateswater.org/

### Overview 

The WaDE 2 organizes data into four specific groups: 

**1. AggregatedAmounts**

**2. Regulatory**

**3. SiteSpecificAmounts**

**4. WaterAllocation**

The data and code for preparation of each group of inputs to WaDE are put into these four directories.
