    Summary
    This dataset provides the Wyoming Water Development Office a statewide dataset of water right locations for groundwater wells.   April, 2020. GCS_North_American_1983. 1:24,000.
    
    Description
    These data represent ground water wells with greater than 500 gallons per minute (GPM) permitted capacity, and which do not have stock watering or coalbed methane as their only beneficial use. All data are sourced from the Wyoming State Engineer's Office (SEO), e-Permit download of 03/02/2019.
    These data may be linked to other water rights-based datasets, including SEO water rights data and Wyoming Water Development Office (WDO) place of use (POU) feature classes, via attribute WR_Number.
