This readme details an overview, the specific steps taken, and the final product of the process applied to water rights data made available by the [Colorado Department of Water Rights (UTDWR)](https://cdnr.us/#/division/DWR) for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange (WaDE). 

### Overview 
The Colorado Department of Water Rights hosts its water right data at the [Colorado Information Marketplace](https://data.colorado.gov/Water/DWR-Water-Right-Net-Amounts/acsg-f33s).
The dataset is updated annually. For more information on WaDE, please visit http://wade.westernstateswater.org/


### Summary
