# NVDWR Reguloatory Overview Data Preparation for WaDE
This readme details the process that was applied by the staff of the [Western States Water Council (WSWC)](http://wade.westernstateswater.org/) to extracting regulatory overlay area data, made available by the [Nevada Division of Water Resources (NVDWR)](http://water.nv.gov/index.aspx), for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange (WaDE) project.  WaDE enables states to share data with each other and the public in a more streamlined and cost-effective way.


## Overview of Data Utilized
The following data was used for regulatory overlay area data...
- **State Engineers Groundwater Basin Designations (compressed zipped shapefile)**.  Special provision for designated groundwater basins (https://home-NVDWR.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/NVDWR::surface-water-standards/about)

The folllowing unique files were created to be used as input.  Input files used are as follows...
- *SE_GroundwaterBasins_DesigOrders_input.csv*.  Contains NVDWR tabular data
- *SE_GroundwaterBasins_DesigOrders.shp.*  Contains shapefile boundary information for the NVDWR areas.


## Summary of Data Prep
The following text summarizes the process used by the WSWC staff to prepare and share NVDWR's water rights data for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange (WaDE 2.0) project.  For a complete mapping outline, see *NV_RegulatoryInfo Schema Mapping to WaDE_QA.xlsx*.  Seven executable code files were used to extract the NVDWR's water rights data from the above mentioned input files.  Each code file is numbered for order of operation.  The first code file (pre-process) was built and ran within [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), the remaining five code files were built and operated within [Pycharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The last two code file _(RegulatoryReportingUnits_fact & RegulatoryOverlayBridge_sites_fact)_ is depended on the previous files.  Those Six code files are as follows...

### 0) Code File: 0_NVRegulatorySourceDataPreprocess.ipynb
Purpose: Pre-process the state agency input data files and merge them into one master file for simple dataframe creation and extraction.

#### Inputs: 
- SE_GroundwaterBasins_DesigOrders_input.csv 
- SE_GroundwaterBasins_DesigOrders.shp

#### Outputs:
 - P_nvRegMaster.csv
 - P_nvRegGeometry.csv

#### Operation and Steps:
- Read the input files and generate temporary input dataframe.
- For NVDWR tabular data...
    - Update **BasinName** to include "Designated" if the provided basin cataogrized as a designated basin, helps prevent duplicate entries with non-designated basins with the same name.
    - Create *in_RegulatoryStatusCV* using **Designated** field as either "Designated" or "Not Designated" entries.
    - Create *in_RegulatoryDescription* using **DesigStatu** field and entries found here [link](https://www.nyecountywaterdistrict.net/161/Designated-Basins-in-Nye-County).
- For NVDWR shapefile data...
    - Use index as **OID_** field.
    - Export **OID_**, **BasinName**, & **geometry** fields to export dataframe.
- Inspect output dataframe for additional errors / datatypes.
- Export output dataframe as new csv file (P_nvRegMaster.csv & P_nvRegGeometry.csv respectively).
