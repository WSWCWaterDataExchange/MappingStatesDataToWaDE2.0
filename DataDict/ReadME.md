# WaDE Data Dictionaries (Templates)
The WaDE data dictionary is an agreed upon metadata schema and information system for sharing water rights and water use data in the United States. WaDE supports the following four fundamental distinct types of water data shared by the member states: i) water allocations (e.g., water rights and permitting data), ii) aggregated water budget estimates such as water supply, withdrawal, consumptive use, return flows, and transfers for reporting units (i.e., geospatial delineations used by the states such as counties, HUCs, and custom delineations) over time as time series, iii) site specific reported water data (i.e., water supply, withdrawal, consumptive use, return flows), and iv) regulatory and institutional constraints at play within states/basins that regulate water supply and use in specific location.  

Below are the metadata Excel workbook templates that define the required and optional metadata items for sharing water rights and water use data in the Water Data Exchange (WaDE) system. The templates are structured in a way that simplified data sharing without needing to understand the underlying database structures. The templates have all common metadata between them with a few unique metadata that define each data type in WaDE.
