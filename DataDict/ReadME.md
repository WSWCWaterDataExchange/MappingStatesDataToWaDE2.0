# WaDE Data Dictionaries (Templates)
Below are the metadata Excel workbook templates that define the required and optional metadata items for sharing water rights and water use data in the Water Data Exchange (WaDE) system. The templates are structured in a way that simplified data sharing without needing to understand the underlying database structures. The templates have all common metadata between them with a few unique metadata that define each data type in WaDE.
