# TWDB Site Specific Data Preparation for WaDE
This readme details the process that was applied by the staff of the [Western States Water Council (WSWC)](http://wade.westernstateswater.org/) to extracting site specific time series water data made available by the [Texas Water Development Board (TWDB)](https://www.twdb.texas.gov/index.asp), for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange (WaDE) project.  WaDE enables states to share data with each other and the public in a more streamlined and consistent way. WaDE is not intended to replace the states data or become the source for that data but rather to enable regional analysis to inform policy decisions and for planning purposes. 


## Overview of Data Utilized
This data is considered sensitive by the TWDB and will not made available to the public.  Input files used to create the data will not be available in the WaDE GitHub.  

However, results will be available to the public through a secure, protected API.  Please contact the WaDE team for more details.
