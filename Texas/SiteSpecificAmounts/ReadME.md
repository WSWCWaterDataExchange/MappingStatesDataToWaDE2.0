# TWDB Site Specific Data Preparation for WaDE
This readme details the process that was applied by the staff of the [Western States Water Council (WSWC)](http://wade.westernstateswater.org/) to extracting site specific time series water data made available by the [Texas Water Development Board (TWDB)](https://www.twdb.texas.gov/index.asp), for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange (WaDE) project.  WaDE enables states to share data with each other and the public in a more streamlined and consistent way. WaDE is not intended to replace the states data or become the source for that data but rather to enable regional analysis to inform policy decisions and for planning purposes. 

## Overview of Data Utilized
The following data was used for timeseries site specific water data...

- [Public Water Systems - Historical](https://www.twdb.texas.gov/waterplanning/waterusesurvey/estimates/index.asp) time series data.  Had to download each region area (A-P) individualy and combine into one workable file.
- [Historical Categorical Connections and Volumes by Public Water System](https://www.twdb.texas.gov/waterplanning/waterusesurvey/estimates/index.asp) annual retail wate ruse volumes 2019-2016.
- [Water Service Boundaries](https://www3.twdb.texas.gov/apps/waterserviceboundaries) shapefile for Public Water Systems site information.
- [20220106 PWS-SurveyNO bridge table]() csv file, provided by personal corespondance between WSWC and TWDB to join Public Water Systems - Historical timeseries data with the Public Water Systems boundary information.

Unique files were created, one used by the WSWC staff to understand the available data (*"_with Notes"*), the second resulting files to be used as input to the Python codes that prepare WaDE2 input files.  Input files used are as follows...
 - HistoricalMunicipal_A.csv -to- HistoricalMunicipal_P.csv
 - PWS_Export.shp
 - 20220106 PWS-SurveyNO bridge table.csv

## Summary of Data Prep
The following text summarizes the process used by the WSWC staff to prepare and share TWDB's site specific time series water data for inclusion into the Water Data Exchange (WaDE 2.0) project.  For a complete mapping outline, see *TX_SiteSpecificAmounts Schema Mapping to WaDE_QA.xlsx*.  Six executable code files were used to extract the state agency's site specific time series data from the above mentioned input files.  Each code file is numbered for order of operation.  The first code file (pre-process) was built and ran within [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), the remaining five code files were built and operated within [Pycharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The last code file *(SiteSpecificAmounts)* is dependent on the previous files.  Those six code files are as follows...

- 3_TXss_Organizations.py
- 4_TXss_WaterSources.py
- 5_TXss_Sites.py
- 6_TXss_SiteSpecificAmounts_fact.py

#### Inputs: 
 - HistoricalMunicipal_A.csv -to- HistoricalMunicipal_P.csv
 - PWS_Export.shp
 - 20220106 PWS-SurveyNO bridge table.csv

#### Outputs:
 - P_txSSMaster.csv

#### Operation and Steps:
- Read in HistoricalMunicipal_A.csv -to- HistoricalMunicipal_P.csv input csv files, PWS_Export.shp shapefile data, 20220106 PWS-SurveyNO bridge table data and place into temporary dataframes.
- Concatenate HistoricalMunicipal data into one long workable dataframe.
- Left join dataframes together.  Join HistoricalMunicipal data -to- 20220106 PWS-SurveyNO bridge table bridge table via **TWDB_Survey_No** and **Water surveyNo No** respectively, and PWS_Export shapefile info via **pwsCode2** with **PWSId**.
- As a whole, there are 6 different timeseries that will be incorporated into the WaDE 2.0 architecture.  These timeseries differ by time interval type and water source typeâ€¦
    - for time interval type: Monthly or Annual
    - for water source type: Groundwater, Surface Water, or Reuse.
- For the data set...
    - WaDE *WaterSourceName* field = specific to water source type and site, based on **Organization**, **Aquifer_Source**, & **Surface_Water_Source** input.
    - WaDE *WaterSourceTypeCV* field = **Water_Type** input.
    - WaDE *CoordinateMethodCV field = **Source** input.
    - WaDE *County* field = **County_Used** input.
    - WaDE *Latitude* field = **Lat** input.
    - WaDE *Longitude* field = **Long** input.
    - WaDE *SiteName* field = **pwsName_y** input.
    - WaDE *SiteNativeID* field = **PWSId** input.
    - WaDE *Amount* field = timeseries specific of **Jan**, **Feb**, **Mar**, **Apr**, **May**, **Jun**, **Jul**, **Aug**, **Sep**, **Oct**, **Nov**, **Dec**, or **Total_Intake__Gallons_** inputs respectively, depending on timeseries of interest.
    - WaDE *Beneficial Use* = dependent on timeseries of interest.
    - WaDE *CommunityWaterSupplySystem* field = **pwsName_y** input.

- Format WaDE *TimeframeStart* & *TimeframeEnd* fields to YYYY-MM_DD format.
- Review for errors.
- Create WaDE Specific *WaterSourceNativeID* field using created *WaterSourceTypeCV* field, helps cut down on searching.
- Export output dataframe as new csv file, *P_txSSMaster.csv*.
