# WaDE Preparation

This repository stores code and data for Texas water rights and uses data made available by the 
[Texas Water Development Board](http://www.twdb.texas.gov/waterplanning/waterusesurvey/estimates/index.asp) for inclusion into the 
Water Data Exchange version 2 (WaDE 2). For more information on WaDE, please visit http://wade.westernstateswater.org/

### Overview 
The WaDE 2 organizes data into four specific groups: 

**1. AggregatedAmounts**

**2. Regulatory**

**3. SiteSpecificAmounts**

**4. WaterAllocation**

The data and code for preparation of each group of inputs to WaDE are put into these four directories.
