# Last Update: 08/01/2022
# Dependents: AllocationsAmounts_fact.py
# Purpose: To assign a single value to the PrimaryUseCategory field for water rights.
# Notes 1) The BUtoWBUDict dictionary for converting Native Beneficial Use -> WaDE Beneficial Use will have to be updated everytime there is a native new benefical use added to the QA.
